### Tech stack

- Rust (async-std, tide)
- Detailed stack in cargo.toml

#### Notes
- Note to self : tide seems to be dead and no longer active/maintained.
- Note: it's inferior to Axum.
- Note: async-std is laughed at by Tokio.
- Note : In May 2022, there was a GitHub discussion asking if the project was still active and the main maintainer for it replied by saying, that while the project is not abandoned in any form, short-term development is more or less staled while he focuses on the underlying Rust features required for projects like Tide to improve (he works at Microsoft but is an dev advocate for rustlang).
